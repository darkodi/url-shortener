## ADR-002: Base62 Encoding for Short Codes

**Date:** 2026-02-03

**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Need to generate unique, short, URL-safe identifiers.

### Decision
Use Base62 encoding (0-9, a-z, A-Z) of auto-increment database IDs.

### Rationale
- No collisions (IDs are unique)
- Short output (6 chars = 56B combinations)
- URL-safe characters only
- Reversible (can decode back to ID)

### Trade-offs
- Sequential IDs are guessable (acceptable for MVP)
- Will address with random offset in later stages
